**Star Schema Design**
- Optimized for query performance and analytics
- Supports incremental refresh for scalability
- Sub-second query times on current dataset

### Key DAX Measures

**Composite Risk Score:**
```dax
Composite Risk Score = 
VAR AmountRisk = 
    IF(AVERAGE(Transaction_Data[Amount]) > 5000, 35,
       IF(AVERAGE(Transaction_Data[Amount]) > 2000, 20, 5))
VAR InternationalRisk = 
    IF(SELECTEDVALUE(Transaction_Data[Is_International]) = "Yes", 25, 0)
VAR VelocityRisk = 
    IF([Customer Transaction Count] > 10, 20, 0)
VAR MerchantRisk = 
    SWITCH(SELECTEDVALUE(Merchant_Reference[Risk_Level]),
        "High", 20, "Medium", 10, 0)
RETURN AmountRisk + InternationalRisk + VelocityRisk + MerchantRisk
```

**Z-Score Anomaly Detection:**
```dax
Amount Z-Score = 
VAR CurrentAmount = AVERAGE(Transaction_Data[Amount])
VAR PopMean = CALCULATE(AVERAGE(Transaction_Data[Amount]), ALL(Transaction_Data))
VAR PopStdDev = CALCULATE(STDEV.P(Transaction_Data[Amount]), ALL(Transaction_Data))
RETURN DIVIDE(CurrentAmount - PopMean, PopStdDev, 0)
```

*See `documentation/DAX_Formulas_Reference.md` for all 20+ measures*
